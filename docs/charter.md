The Decentralized Ecosystem Growth (DEG) program aims to aggregate, develop, and integrate tools that facilitate coordination of decentralized applications across disparate financial services firms and ecosystems. This is still a new and evolving landscape. The DEG program looks to help firms move beyond the hype surrounding many decentralized technologies and to provide an open venue for everyone, both large firms and individual developers, to work together to accelerate delivery of tangible value.
