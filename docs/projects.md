## Call for Projects
We started this group to focus on projects that investigate:
* Replication of common pre-, on-, and post-trade workflows via modular and verifiable smart contracts
* Transferring data models for common financial assets to digital tokens
* Data confidentiality, privacy design, zero-knowledge systems
* Data oracle design, decentralized data authentication and access schemes
* System migration and integration (internal, between similar networks, between disparate networks)

## Active Projects
* *IHS Markit, Clovyr* - Private project, to be announced
* *Clovyr* - Financial libraries that integrate with the larger Clovyr offering
