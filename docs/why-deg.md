# Why Decentralized Ecosystem Growth
The Decentralized Ecosystem Program ("DEG") program aims to aggregate, develop, and integrate tools that facilitate coordination of decentralized applications across disparate financial services firms and ecosystems. This is still a new and evolving landscape. The DEG program looks to help firms move beyond the hype surrounding many decentralized technologies and to provide an open venue for everyone, both large firms and individual developers, to work together to accelerate delivery of tangible value.

## Business Focus
The delivery of open-sourced, practical code, that can link activity across the industry including repositories both within and outside of FINOS will accelerate this burgeoning technology ecosystem and reduce time-to-market for decentralized financial applications. The DEG program allows FINOS members and contributors to collaborate to iteratively evaluate, deploy, and build decentralized technology across firms, including market competitors, and amongst disparate technology stacks (e.g., different blockchains)

## Sample Use Cases
Use cases are far reaching, for example:
- Test trade workflows passing between a private and public dapp.
- Develop tools to seamlessly link data from different trusted parties, e.g. validate counterparties, credit and settlement.

## Focus Areas
- Develop and release [Clovyr](https://clovyr.io/) libraries and financial integrations
- Drive ecosystem growth with engagement from relevant groups to facilitate cooperation and test interactivity
